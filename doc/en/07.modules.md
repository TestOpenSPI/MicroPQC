# Modules

This project is built and linked by modules. You can add/remove modules, or create new ones, depending on your development needs.

## Application Makefile configuration

All modules are configured from the application's Makefile. The following explains the key options.

```makefile
# applications/helloworld/Makefile

BOARD ?= SHIELD_M2354 # Target board. boards/SHIELD_M2354 is included in the build.

OS = freertos # Select the RTOS. FreeRTOS is used.

TRUSTZONE = nonsecure # TrustZone runs in the Non-Secure world (fixed).

SECURE_FW = GENERIC_M2354_KPQC # Secure firmware profile to use.
SECURE_VER = V2.0.0 # Secure firmware version. secure/V2.0.0/[BOARD] is included in the build.
SECURE_BANK = SINGLE # Bank mode (DUAL or SINGLE). Currently fixed.

# Select the modules to include.
USEMODULE += shell hexdump 
USEMODULE += axiocrypto_nonsecure_sdk
USEMODULE += axiocrypto_pqc_example
USEMODULE += spiflash mtd
USEMODULE += utils
USEMODULE += printf

INCLUDE_TESTLIB = 1 # Include test code. Each module's _test/ directory is included in the build.

QUIET = 1 # Build log verbosity. 0: full output, 1: concise output
```
